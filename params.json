{"name":"fifoirc","body":"### About\r\n\r\nfifoirc is an IRC bot that can be used to make a fifo connected to an IRC\r\nchannel. Any text written to this fifo will be spoken in the channel by\r\nthe bot.\r\n\r\n### Compiling\r\n\r\nRunning `make` from the directory containing fifoirc.c should be enough to\r\ncompile the program. This can be followed by `make install` if you want to\r\ninstall it.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nA list of options accepted by fifoirc can be obtained by running `fifoirc` with\r\nno arguments. Generally, usage will be like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  $ fifoirc -s irc.freenode.net -n nickname -c \"#maximilian\" -f ~/irc-pipe\r\n```\r\n\r\nFifoirc will make the pipe at `~/irc-pipe`, connect to `irc.freenode.net`, set\r\nthe nickname to `nickname`, and join `#maximilian`. The quotes around\r\n`#maximilian` are to prevent the shell from treating everything after the hash\r\n(#) as a comment. From this point, any text written to ~/irc-pipe will be sent\r\nby fifoirc to the IRC channel.\r\n\r\nIf you want fifoirc to authenticate with NickServ, use the -P option.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or just want to contact me for any reason, send an email to\r\n  James Stanley <james@incoherency.co.uk>\r\nor find me on IRC as the user `jamesstanley` on `irc.freenode.net`. I am\r\nusually in the channel `#maximilian`, so you'll probably find me in there.","tagline":"Creates a fifo that can be written to, producing text in an IRC channel.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
