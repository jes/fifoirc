1. Compiling
------------

Running `make' from the directory containing fifoirc.c should be enough to
compile the program. This can be followed by `make install' if you want to
install it.

2. Usage
--------

A list of options accepted by fifoirc can be obtained by running `fifoirc' with
no arguments. Generally, usage will be like so:
  $ fifoirc -s irc.freenode.net -n fifo_client -c "#maximilian" -f ~/irc-pipe
Fifoirc will make the pipe at `~/irc-pipe', connect to `irc.freenode.net', set
the nickname to `nickname', and join `#maximilian'. The quotes around
`#maximilian' are to prevent the shell from treating everything after the hash
(#) as a comment. From this point, any text written to ~/irc-pipe will be sent
by fifoirc to the IRC channel.

If you want fifoirc to authenticate with NickServ, use the -P option.

3. Contact
----------

If you find a bug or just want to contact me for any reason, send an email to
  James Stanley <james@incoherency.co.uk>
or find me on IRC as the user `jamesstanley' on `irc.freenode.net'. I am
usually in the channel `#maximilian', so you'll probably find me in there.
